Here is the code you guys asked me to write. I wrote it in NetBeans, its a free software for java code compilation and management. 
I had problems exporting the code into a jar.file because I could not find my "project dist folder". 
So I have uploaded the raw code syntax without the packaging extremities. You should be able to copy the code into any compiler to run it.
